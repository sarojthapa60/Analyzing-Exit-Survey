# Analyzing-Exit-Survey

Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys
Introduction:

Exit surveys are conducted by a company when its employees leave the company for various reasons such as retirement, contract expiration, resignation, and termination. The primary purpose of an exit survey is to find out the overall work experience of an employee at the company. Exit surveys can be used to gain valuable feedback from employees in order to improve aspects of the organization, better retain employees, and reduce turnovers.

My end goal of this project is to answer the following questions:

Are employees who have only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
What about the employees who have been at the job longer?
