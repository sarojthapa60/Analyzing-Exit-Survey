    "\n",
    "Exit surveys are conducted by a company when its employees leave the company for various reasons such as retirement, contract expiration, resignation, and termination. The primary purpose of an exit survey is to find out the overall work experience of an employee at the company. Exit surveys can be used to gain valuable feedback from employees in order to improve aspects of the organization, better retain employees, and reduce turnovers.       "
